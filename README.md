Home Connect home appliances plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).

</span>

[Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com), [Balay](https://www.balay.es/), [Bosch](https://www.bosch-home.com/), [Constructa](https://www.constructa.com/), [Gaggenau](https://www.gaggenau.com/), [NEFF](https://www.neff-home.com/), [Pitsos](https://www.pitsos.gr/), [Profilo](https://www.profilo.com/), [Siemens](https://www.siemens-home.bsh-group.com/), and [Thermador](https://www.thermador.com/) are trademarks of [BSH Home Appliances](https://www.bsh-group.com).

## Installation

1. Connect your home appliances with Home Connect:
   1. Install Home Connect from the Apple App Store for your country (e.g. [UK](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/home-connect-app/id901397789) or [USA](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/home-connect-america/id1134525430)).
   1. Create an account using your email address, click on the validation link in the email that will be received, and then return to the app and login.
   1. Connect the appliances to your home network, either via the app or using Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS).
   1. Connect the appliances to the app (by following the installation guide provided with the appliance).
1. If you are using a legacy Home Connect account then also create a [SingleKey ID](https://singlekey-id.com/en/sign-up/) using the same email address, ensuring that it is all in lowercase.
1. Obtain a Home Connect application *Client ID*:
   1. Sign-up for a free [Home Connect Developer Program](https://developer.home-connect.com/user/register) account and login.
   1. [Register a new application](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications/add), ensuring that:
      1.  *OAuth Flow* is set to *Device Flow*
      1.  *Home Connect User Account* is the same as the SingleKey ID email address
      1.  *Redirect URI* is not empty (you could set to `http://homebridge.local/plugins`)
   1. Save the displayed *Client ID* to include in the Homebridge `config.json` file.
1. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-homeconnect`
1. Edit `config.json` and add the HomeConnect platform (see example below).
1. Run [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).
1. The Homebridge log output will include an authorisation URL. Copy the listed URL into a web browser and login to your Home Connect account. (The authorisation URL can also be found in the [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) graphical settings editor.)
 
### Example `config.json`
```JSON
{
    "platforms":
    [{
        "platform":     "HomeConnect",
        "clientid":     "0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF"
    }]
}
```
The `clientid` should be set to the *Client ID* obtained from the [Home Connect Developer Program](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications) for the created *Device Flow* application.

Additional configuration is recommended to [customise the appliance programs](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/Programs). The easiest way to do this is via the [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) (version 4.8.1 or later) graphical settings editor. This plugin dynamically updates its configuration schema with the appropriate options for the connected appliances.

See [`config.json`](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/config.json) for a description of all supported configuration options.

## Appliance Support

This plugin supports most capabilities of the [Home Connect API](https://developer.home-connect.com/) that can be sensibly mapped to Apple-defined [HomeKit services and characteristics](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/Functionality). More details can be found in the [functionality summary](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/Functionality).

Apple's Home app does not support all of the features of this plugin. Some [third-party HomeKit apps](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/HomeKit-Apps) are recommended due to their extra functionality.

## Reporting Issues

Report any issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/issues/new/choose).

Before raising an issue please check whether it relates to an expected [error message](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/Errors) and whether any similar [issues already exist](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=). If the issue relates to a problem connecting to the Home Connect servers or with controlling an appliance then please also:

  * Using the official Home Connect app:
    * Confirm that the appliance can be properly controlled as expected.
    * Open the appliance Settings, scroll to the Network section, and verify that all three lines (for the links between the appliance, cloud, and phone) and green.
  * Check the status of the Home Connect servers using:
    * The official [Home Connect System Status](https://www.home-connect.com/global/help-support/system-status) page.
    * The unofficial [Home Connect Server Status](https://homeconnect.thouky.co.uk) page.

Please attach the relevant section of the Homebridge log file, either pasted into the issue or attached as a text file (*not a screenshot*). Extra debug should be enabled and captured if appropriate:

  * **Homebridge debug logging:** Start Homebridge with the `-D` option to capture the *debug* level messages. These are used by this plugin to log basic information about each request to the Home Connect servers (but not the actual contents of the requests or responses) and other internal state. Please enable this for any issues that involve problems connecting to the Home Connect servers, API errors, or other problems with appliance state or control.
  * **HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP) logging:** Setting the `DEBUG=*` environment variable before starting Homebridge results in verbose logging of all [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) HomeKit exchanges. Please enable this for any issues that involve problems controlling appliances from HomeKit or Siri.
